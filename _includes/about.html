<p>As a UX researcher, I leverage my background in the social sciences and economics to take a mixed methods approach to my work. I drive research end-to-end throughout the product development lifecycle, manage researchers, and coach cross-functional colleagues on best practices in research. I attended college in the heart of Silicon Valley (go Cardinal!) and spent several years living in DC where I attended graduate school. My research has taken me around the world from Mexico to Uganda and back to the US. I currently live and work in New York City.</p>
