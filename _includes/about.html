<p>As a UX researcher, I leverage my background in the social sciences and economics to take a mixed methods approach to my work. I drive research end-to-end throughout the product development lifecycle, manage junior researchers, and teach research best practices to cross-functional colleagues. I attended college in the heart of Silicon Valley (go Cardinal!), and spent several years living in DC where I attended graduate school. My research has taken me around the world from Mexico to Uganda and back to the US. I currently live in New York, and I conduct user research on knowledge management products at McKinsey & Company.</p>
